As someone who did not learn programming until about 2nd year in university, I quickly realised how crucial it is to understand how to code in order to run data analysis. There is no way to succeed in data science and build statistical machine learning models without a single line of code. Even if you don't see yourself in a technical field, it is still very important to learn some foundational level of programming so you can at least understand some parts of it.

This is exactly why I have developed (created materials from scratch) and ran introductory workshops to students who have little to no experience with coding. This includes:

### Python for Data Visualisation

- Presented in September 2018 at the University of Sydney (40 students)
- Brief introduction to Data Science and Data Visualisation ([slides](https://github.com/jeffreycklo/python_workshop/blob/master/BISA_Workshop_Python_v2cS.pdf))
- Jupyter Notebook 1: Python essentials ([student version](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycklo/python_workshop/blob/master/activity_1.ipynb)) ([full solutions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycklo/python_workshop/blob/master/activity_1_solution.ipynb))
- Jupyter Notebook 2: Data visualisation ([student version](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycklo/python_workshop/blob/master/activity_2.ipynb)) ([full solutions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycklo/python_workshop/blob/master/activity_2_solution.ipynb))

### SQL for Data Analysis

- Presented in May 2019 at the University of Sydney (40 students)
- SQL Fundamentals with exercises ([student version slides](https://github.com/jeffreycklo/sql_workshop/blob/master/SQL_Workshop_Student_Version.pdf)) ([presenter version slides](https://github.com/jeffreycklo/sql_workshop/blob/master/SQL_Workshop_Full_Version.pdf))

### Tableau for Data Visualisation

- Presented in September 2019 at the University of Sydney (65 students)
- Tableau Dashboard developed ([view on Tableau Public here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jeffrey.lo#!/vizhome/KickstarterDashboardTechnology/TechDashboard))
