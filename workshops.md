As someone who did not learn programming until about 2nd year in university, I quickly realised how crucial it is to understand how to code in order to run data analysis. There is no way to succeed in data science and build statistical machine learning models without a single line of code. Even if you don't see yourself in a technical field, it is still very important to learn some foundational level of programming so you can at least understand some parts of it.

This is exactly why I have developed (created materials from scratch) and ran introductory workshops to students who have little to no experience with coding. This includes:

### Python for Data Visualisation

- Presented in September 2018 at the University of Sydney (40 students)
- Brief introduction to Data Science and Data Visualisation ([slides](https://github.com/jeffreycklo/python_workshop/blob/master/BISA_Workshop_Python_v2cS.pdf))
- Jupyter Notebook 1: Python essentials ([student version](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycklo/python_workshop/blob/master/activity_1.ipynb)) ([full solutions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycklo/python_workshop/blob/master/activity_1_solution.ipynb))
- Jupyter Notebook 2: Data visualisation ([student version](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycklo/python_workshop/blob/master/activity_2.ipynb)) ([full solutions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycklo/python_workshop/blob/master/activity_2_solution.ipynb))

### SQL for Data Analysis

- Presented in May 2019 at the University of Sydney (40 students)
- SQL Fundamentals with exercises ([student version slides](https://github.com/jeffreycklo/sql_workshop/blob/master/SQL_Workshop_Student_Version.pdf)) ([presenter version slides](https://github.com/jeffreycklo/sql_workshop/blob/master/SQL_Workshop_Full_Version.pdf))

### Data Visualisation using Tableau

- Presented in September 2019 at the University of Sydney (60 students)
- Tableau Dashboard developed during the workshop ([view on Tableau Public here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jeffrey.lo#!/vizhome/KickstarterDashboardTechnology/TechDashboard))

### Visual Analytics using Tableau

- Presented in March 2020 at the University of Sydney (over 500 registrations and 350 attendees via Zoom Webinar)
- Tableau Dashboard developed during the workshop ([view on Tableau Public here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jeffrey.lo#!/vizhome/KickstarterDashboardStudentWorkshop/KickstarterDashboard))

### 2020 Inter-University Tableau Data Case Competition

- Lead in organising the April 2020 case competition for NSW students (primarily University of Sydney, University of New South Wales and Macquarie University)
- Over 25 teams competed (100+ students), with 10 teams presented during a presentation night (over Zoom) to a panel of Tableau consultants and Student Ambassadors
